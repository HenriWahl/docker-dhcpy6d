# docker-dhcpy6d

Dockerfile and related stuff for https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d.

Because the main feature of *dhcpy6d* is its access to the requesting clients MAC addresses,
it makes no sense to run inside an own container network.

## How to use it

The work directory inside container is `/dhcpy6d` - the directory `dhcpy6d` is intended to be mounted as volume there.
It should at least contain the file `dhcpy6d.conf`, which has to be configured according to https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d/blob/master/doc/dhcpy6d.conf.rst.
For a simple test run the network interface should be set.

If SQLite is choosen as storage for the client leases the delivered `/dhcpy6d/volatile.sqlite` might be used.

As mentioned above - most useful when being run with `--network host` parameter or `network_mode: host` in `docker-compose.yml` file.
Otherwise there is no way the client MAC addresses could be transmitted.

**Attention:** to really deliver addresses to clients the option `really_do_it` has to be set to `yes`.
This is a safety measure to avoid chaos - there still is plenty of it.

### docker run

A very simple call might be something like

```
# docker build -t dhcpy6d .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  197.1kB

Successfully tagged dhcpy6d:latest
# docker run -dit --rm --name dhcpy6d --network host -v $PWD/dhcpy6d:/dhcpy6d dhcpy6d:latest

```

### docker-compose

Even simpler is the use of `docker-compose`:

```
# docker-compose up
